                <p id="aboutearth">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and
                    the only astronomical object known to harbor
                    life. About 29% of Earth's surface is land
                    consisting of continents and islands.
                    The remaining 71% is covered with water,
                    mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers
                    and other fresh water, which together
                    constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's
                    polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's
                    outer layer is divided into several rigid
                    tectonic plates that migrate across the
                    surface over many millions of years.According 
                    to radiometric dating estimation and other 
                    evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years
                     ago. Within the first billion years of 
                     Earth's history, life appeared in the 
                     oceans and began to affect Earth's 
                     atmosphere and surface, leading to 
                     the proliferation of anaerobic and,
                    later, aerobic organisms. Some
                     geological evidence indicates 
                    that life may have arisen as 
                    early as 4.1 billion years ago. 
                    Since then, the combination of
                    Earth's distance from the Sun,
                    physical properties and geological
                    history have allowed life to 
                    evolve and thrive.

                <p id="aboutnature">Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.[1]
The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[2] In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord</p>

                    <p id="abouttourist">Places of natural beauty such as beaches, tropical island resorts, national parks, mountains, deserts and forests, are examples of traditional tourist attractions which people may visit. Cultural tourist attractions can include historical places, monuments, ancient temples, zoos, aquaria, museums and art galleries, botanical gardens, buildings and structures (such as forts, castles, libraries, former prisons, skyscrapers, bridges), theme parks and carnivals, living history museums, public art (sculptures, statues, murals), ethnic enclave communities, historic trains and cultural events. Factory tours, industrial heritage, creative art and crafts workshops are the object of cultural niches like industrial tourism and creative tourism. Many tourist attractions are also landmarks. But sports events such as a soccer game, Formula 1 race or sailing regatta can also attract tourists.</p>
